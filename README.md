# Food Finder

Food Finder is a Ruby command line application.

Users can add and search for restaurants. Their restaurant list will be saved in a file named 'restaurants.txt', in a tab-delimited format.

To add multiple restaurants quickly, the user can edit the file in a text editor.

### Requirements
The application requires Ruby be installed on your computer. After downloading and unzipping the files, you can then run the command 'ruby init.rb' from inside of the unzipped folder.
